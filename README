Lending Club Data Analysis

The goal of the analysis is to predict the loan status of an applicant, whether he/she will default on a loan or not.
Apart from determination of loan status, we want to quantify the demographics of the people taking the loan, by using visualizations
and gain insight into what type of applicants are deemed risky or safe.
The methodology employed for prediction of loan status is Random Forest.
